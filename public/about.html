<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello!!</p>
  
<p>My name is Zeliha and I'm 28 years old. I am a geologist. I finished my master's degree last year (2023). 
  It was kind of challenging but also an improving process for me. Besides this, I am interested in social problems 
  in my country. And I love animals. Especially dogs and cats. We have 8 cats more or less, 
  we are feeding them in our garden. All of them have a name, a funny name. I love them all.

  Enough for personal life details. So after working in the field, I decided to change my job. 
  Because it does not fit my lifestyle, On second thought I wanted to try coding and I love it. 
  I was thinking "I am not good at using technology" but I love it. For now, I am trying to improve 
  myself and this is one of my first tries.
